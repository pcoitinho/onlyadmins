# Only Admins - Restrict Dev and Staging site to admins.
> Only Admins is a minimal plugin that restricts your entire WordPress site to Admins. Best used as a MU-Plugin on Development and Staging sites.

## Getting Started

OnlyAdmins has no configuration.

Just drop into your `wp-content/plugins` folder.

Your entire website will be restricted to logged in administrators.

## Installing as a MU-plugin

Only Admins is best suited to be installed as a Must-Use Plugin (MU Plugin).

MU Plugins are activated automatically and do not show up in the plugins page, so they cannot be deactivated by mistake.

To install Only Admins as a MU Plugin, copy only the `onlyadmins.php` (not in its parent folder) file directly to your `wp-content/mu-plugins` folder. You might have to create the mu-plugins folder.

## License

Only Admins is liscenced under the General Public Liscence version 2 (GPLv2) liscence.
